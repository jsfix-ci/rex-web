<p id="fs-idm16266560">The other halogen molecules (F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and At<sub>2</sub>) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom.

<p id="fs-idm45369344">The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in CCl<sub>4</sub> (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH<sub>4</sub> (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:</p>

<p id="fs-idm1862800">Many covalent molecules have central atoms that do not have eight electrons in their Lewis structures. These molecules fall into three categories:</p>

<li>Electron-deficient molecules have a central atom that has fewer electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.</li>
<li>Hypervalent molecules have a central atom that has more electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.</li>
</ul>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm33391760"><h4 data-type="title">Odd-electron Molecules</h4>
<p id="fs-idp58165584">We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons <span data-type="term" group-by="f" id="term325">free radicals</span>. Nitric oxide, NO, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react at high temperatures.</p>
<p id="fs-idm51238992">To draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same five steps we would for other molecules, but with a few minor changes:</p><ol id="fs-idp52495568" type="1">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons</em>. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from N) + 6 (from O) = 11. The odd number immediately tells us that we have a free radical, so we know that not every atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule</em>. We can easily draw a skeleton with an N–O single bond:<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
N–O</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms</em>. In this case, there is no central atom, so we distribute the electrons around both atoms. We give eight electrons to the more electronegative atom in these situations; thus oxygen has the filled valence shell:<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>

In this case, nitrogen has only five electrons around it. To move closer to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double bond. (We cannot take another lone pair of electrons on oxygen and form a triple bond because nitrogen would then have nine electrons:)<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>

<p id="fs-idm12065312">We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride, BeH<sub>2</sub>, and boron trifluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in BF<sub>3</sub>, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B–F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B–F single bonds and an electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with an electron deficient boron. However, the B–F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B–F single bonds, indicating that some double bond character is found in the actual molecule.</p><span class="scaled-down" data-alt="Two Lewis structures are shown.
