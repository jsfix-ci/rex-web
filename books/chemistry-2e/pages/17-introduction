<p id="fs-idm9057728">Another chapter in this text introduced the chemistry of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions. This important reaction class is defined by changes in oxidation states for one or more reactant elements, and it includes a subset of reactions involving the transfer of electrons between reactant species. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, chemists began exploring ways these electrons could be transferred <em data-effect="italics">indirectly</em> via an external circuit rather than directly via intimate contact of redox reactants. In the two centuries since, the field of <em data-effect="italics">electrochemistry</em> has evolved to yield significant insights on the fundamental aspects of redox chemistry as well as a wealth of technologies ranging from industrial-scale metallurgical processes to robust, rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_17_00_EVCharging">Figure 17.1</a>). In this chapter, the essential concepts of electrochemistry will be addressed.</p>
