<p id="fs-idp55691520">As was the case for gaseous substances, the kinetic molecular theory may be used to explain the behavior of solids and liquids. In the following description, the term <em data-effect="italics">particle</em> will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion. Note that we will use the popular phrase “intermolecular attraction” to refer to attractive forces between the particles of a substance, regardless of whether these particles are molecules, atoms, or ions.</p>

<p id="fs-idp57413920">Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and gaseous matter:</p>

<ul data-bullet-style="bullet" id="fs-idm45003248">
<li>Particles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular pattern; in a liquid, they are close together with no regular arrangement; in a gas, they are far apart with no regular arrangement.</li>
<li>Particles in a solid vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in relation to one another; in a liquid, they move past each other but remain in essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move independently of one another except when they collide.</li>
</ul>

<p id="fs-idm53508384">The differences in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas reflect the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase. The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its <span data-type="term" group-by="i" id="term416">intermolecular forces</span> (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules. IMFs are the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module. These forces serve to hold particles close together, whereas the particles’ KE provides the energy required to overcome the attractive forces and thus increase the distance between particles. <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_10_01_KMTPhases1">Figure 10.2</a> illustrates how changes in physical state may be induced by changing the temperature, hence, the average KE, of a given substance.</p>

<p id="fs-idm59044480">We can also liquefy many gases by compressing them, if the temperature is not too high. The increased pressure brings the molecules of a gas closer together, such that the attractions between the molecules become strong relative to their KE. Consequently, they form liquids. Butane, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, is the fuel used in disposable lighters and is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. Inside the lighter’s fuel compartment, the butane is compressed to a pressure that results in its condensation to the liquid state, as shown in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_10_01_ButanePhase">Figure 10.4</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp15601504">Under appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will cause them to form liquids or solids. This is due to intermolecular forces, not <em data-effect="italics">intra</em>molecular forces. <em data-effect="italics">Intra</em>molecular forces are those <em data-effect="italics">within</em> the molecule that keep the molecule together, for example, the bonds between the atoms. <em data-effect="italics">Inter</em>molecular forces are the attractions <em data-effect="italics">between</em> molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance. <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_10_01_IntravInter">Figure 10.5</a> illustrates these different molecular forces. The strengths of these attractive forces vary widely, though usually the IMFs between small molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces that bond atoms together within a molecule. For example, to overcome the IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it into gaseous HCl requires only about 17 kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl requires about 25 times more energy—430 kilojoules.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm146733840"><h3 data-type="title">Dispersion Forces</h3>
<p id="fs-idp26129792">One of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="L" id="term418">London dispersion force</span> in honor of German-born American physicist Fritz <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="L" id="term419">London</span> who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the <span data-type="term" group-by="d" id="term420">dispersion force</span>. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron’s location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop a temporary, <span data-type="term" group-by="i" id="term421">instantaneous dipole</span> if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an <span data-type="term" group-by="i" id="term422">induced dipole</span>. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species—a so-called dispersion force like that illustrated in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_10_01_DispForces">Figure 10.6</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idm135149056">The increase in melting and boiling points with increasing atomic/molecular size may be rationalized by considering how the strength of dispersion forces is affected by the electronic structure of the atoms or molecules in the substance. In a larger atom, the valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei than in a smaller atom. Thus, they are less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that produce the attraction. The measure of how easy or difficult it is for another electrostatic charge (for example, a nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecule’s charge distribution (its electron cloud) is known as <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="term423">polarizability</span>. A molecule that has a charge cloud that is easily distorted is said to be very polarizable and will have large dispersion forces; one with a charge cloud that is difficult to distort is not very polarizable and will have small dispersion forces.</p>

Order the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to highest boiling point: CH<sub>4</sub>, SiH<sub>4</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>, and SnH<sub>4</sub>. Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p id="fs-idm106734480"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
Applying the skills acquired in the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry, all of these compounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the molecule, the less polarizable and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the dispersion forces. The molar masses of CH<sub>4</sub>, SiH<sub>4</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>, and SnH<sub>4</sub> are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol, 77 g/mol, and 123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH<sub>4</sub> is expected to have the lowest boiling point and SnH<sub>4</sub> the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to highest boiling point is expected to be CH<sub>4</sub> &lt; SiH<sub>4</sub> &lt; GeH<sub>4</sub> &lt; SnH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp136003920">A graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the group 14 element shows this prediction to be correct:</p>

<p id="fs-idm93742928">The shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces between them.

In 2000, Kellar <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="A" id="term424">Autumn</span>, who leads a multi-institutional gecko research team, found that geckos adhered equally well to both polar silicon dioxide and nonpolar gallium arsenide. This proved that geckos stick to surfaces because of dispersion forces—weak intermolecular attractions arising from temporary, synchronized charge distributions between adjacent molecules. Although dispersion forces are very weak, the total attraction over millions of spatulae is large enough to support many times the gecko’s weight.</p>
<p id="fs-idm74321904">In 2014, two scientists developed a model to explain how geckos can rapidly transition from “sticky” to “non-sticky.” Alex <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="G" id="term425">Greaney</span> and Congcong <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="H" id="term426">Hu</span> at Oregon State University described how geckos can achieve this by changing the angle between their spatulae and the surface. Geckos’ feet, which are normally nonsticky, become sticky when a small shear force is applied. By curling and uncurling their toes, geckos can alternate between sticking and unsticking from a surface, and thus easily move across it. Further investigations may eventually lead to the development of better adhesives and other applications.</p>

<p id="fs-idm25328160">Recall from the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that <em data-effect="italics">polar</em> molecules have a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of the molecule—a separation of charge called a <em data-effect="italics">dipole</em>. Consider a polar molecule such as hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl atom bears the partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction between the positive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This attractive force is called a <span data-type="term" group-by="d" id="term427">dipole-dipole attraction</span>—the electrostatic force between the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of another, as illustrated in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_10_01_DipDip">Figure 10.9</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp108426992">The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of HCl molecules to nonpolar F<sub>2</sub> molecules. Both HCl and F<sub>2</sub> consist of the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass. At a temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE. However, the dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause them to “stick together” to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion forces between nonpolar F<sub>2</sub> molecules are not, and so this substance is gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to F<sub>2</sub> (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar F<sub>2</sub> molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths of IMFs of attraction present within different substances.</p>

CO and N<sub>2</sub> are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience similar London dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences dipole-dipole attractions. Because N<sub>2</sub> is nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit dipole-dipole attractions.

<p id="fs-idp18167328">Nitrosyl fluoride (ONF, molecular mass 49 amu) is a gas at room temperature. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O, molecular mass 18 amu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or 3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively small sizes of F, O, or N atoms, leads to <em data-effect="italics">highly concentrated partial charges</em> with these atoms.

<p id="fs-idp128658848">Despite use of the word “bond,” keep in mind that hydrogen bonds are <em data-effect="italics">intermolecular</em> attractive forces, not <em data-effect="italics">intramolecular</em> attractive forces (covalent bonds). Hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about 5 to 10% as strong, but are generally much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.</p>
<p id="fs-idp20088928">Hydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids and solids).

As we progress down any of these groups, the polarities of the molecules decrease slightly, whereas the sizes of the molecules increase substantially.

<p id="fs-idp113560512">Each nucleotide contains a (deoxyribose) sugar bound to a phosphate group on one side, and one of four nitrogenous bases on the other. Two of the bases, cytosine (C) and thymine (T), are single-ringed structures known as pyrimidines. The other two, adenine (A) and guanine (G), are double-ringed structures called purines. These bases form complementary base pairs consisting of one purine and one pyrimidine, with adenine pairing with thymine, and cytosine with guanine. Each base pair is held together by hydrogen bonding. A and T share two hydrogen bonds, C and G share three, and both pairings have a similar shape and structure <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_10_01_DNA2">Figure 10.14</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp108968272">The cumulative effect of millions of hydrogen bonds effectively holds the two strands of DNA together. Importantly, the two strands of DNA can relatively easily “unzip” down the middle since hydrogen bonds are relatively weak compared to the covalent bonds that hold the atoms of the individual DNA molecules together. This allows both strands to function as a template for replication.</p>
