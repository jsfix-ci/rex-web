<p id="fs-idm241568976">Among the factors affecting chemical reaction rates discussed earlier in this chapter was the presence of a <em data-effect="italics">catalyst</em>, a substance that can increase the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction. The concepts introduced in the previous section on reaction mechanisms provide the basis for understanding how catalysts are able to accomplish this very important function.</p>

<p id="fs-idm627108512"><a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_12_07_CatReCoDig">Figure 12.19</a> shows reaction diagrams for a chemical process in the absence and presence of a catalyst. Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with <em data-effect="italics">a notably lesser activation energy</em>. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn’t necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower <em data-effect="italics">E</em><sub>a</sub>).</p>

The ozone layer protects earth from solar radiation by absorbing ultraviolet light. As chemical reactions deplete the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere, a measurable “hole” forms above Antarctica, and an increase in the amount of solar ultraviolet radiation— strongly linked to the prevalence of skin cancers—reaches earth’s surface. The work of Molina and Rowland was instrumental in the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987 that successfully began phasing out production of chemicals linked to ozone destruction.</p>
<p id="fs-idm4297296">Molina and Rowland demonstrated that chlorine atoms from human-made chemicals can catalyze ozone destruction in a process similar to that by which NO accelerates the depletion of ozone. Chlorine atoms are generated when chlorocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons—once widely used as refrigerants and propellants—are photochemically decomposed by ultraviolet light or react with hydroxyl radicals.

As such, a deficiency of a particular enzyme can translate to a life-threatening disease. G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency, a genetic condition that results in a shortage of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans. This enzyme, shown in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_12_07_Gluc6PhoDe">Figure 12.21</a>, is the rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolic pathway that supplies NADPH to cells (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_12_07_HMPShuntPa">Figure 12.22</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idm31937584">A <span data-type="term" group-by="h" id="term564">heterogeneous catalyst</span> is a catalyst that is present in a different phase (usually a solid) than the reactants.

<ol id="fs-idm202987392" type="1">
<li>Adsorption of the reactant(s) onto the surface of the catalyst</li>
<li>Activation of the adsorbed reactant(s)</li>

<li>Desorption of product(s) from the surface of the catalyst</li></ol>

<p id="fs-idm189720768">Enzyme molecules possess an active site, a part of the molecule with a shape that allows it to bond to a specific substrate (a reactant molecule), forming an enzyme-substrate complex as a reaction intermediate. There are two models that attempt to explain how this active site works. The most simplistic model is referred to as the lock-and-key hypothesis, which suggests that the molecular shapes of the active site and substrate are complementary, fitting together like a key in a lock. The induced fit hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the enzyme molecule is flexible and changes shape to accommodate a bond with the substrate. This is not to suggest that an enzyme’s active site is completely malleable, however. Both the lock-and-key model and the induced fit model account for the fact that enzymes can only bind with specific substrates, since in general a particular enzyme only catalyzes a particular reaction (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#CNX_Chem_12_07_Enzyme">Figure 12.25</a>).</p>
