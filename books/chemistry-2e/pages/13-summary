<p id="fs-idp125631520">A reversible reaction is at equilibrium when the forward and reverse processes occur at equal rates. Chemical equilibria are dynamic processes characterized by constant amounts of reactant and product species.</p>

<p id="fs-idp165520928">The composition of a reaction mixture may be represented by a mathematical function known as the reaction quotient, <em data-effect="italics">Q</em>. For a reaction at equilibrium, the composition is constant, and <em data-effect="italics">Q</em> is called the equilibrium constant, <em data-effect="italics">K</em>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp116522496">A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases.</p>

<p id="fs-idp7945600">Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and pressure. The system’s response to these disturbances is described by Le Châtelier’s principle: An equilibrium system subjected to a disturbance will shift in a way that counters the disturbance and re-establishes equilibrium. A catalyst will increase the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions of a reversible process, increasing the rate at which equilibrium is reached but not altering the equilibrium mixture’s composition (<em data-effect="italics">K</em> does not change).</p>

<p id="fs-idp273866592">Calculating values for equilibrium constants and/or equilibrium concentrations is of practical benefit to many applications. A mathematical strategy that uses initial concentrations, changes in concentrations, and equilibrium concentrations (and goes by the acronym ICE) is useful for several types of equilibrium calculations.</p>
