                          This text is an atoms-first adaptation of OpenStax
                          <em data-effect="italics">Chemistry 2e</em>. The intention of “atoms-first” involves a few basic principles: first, it introduces atomic and molecular structure much earlier than the traditional approach, and it threads these themes through subsequent chapters. This approach may be chosen as a way to delay the introduction of material such as stoichiometry that students traditionally find abstract and difficult, thereby allowing students time to acclimate their study skills to chemistry. Additionally, it gives students a basis for understanding the application of quantitative principles to the chemistry that underlies the entire course. It also aims to center the study of chemistry on the atomic foundation that many will expand upon in a later course covering organic chemistry, easing that transition when the time arrives.

                            <em data-effect="italics">Chemistry: Atoms First 2e</em>, we strive to make chemistry, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts of chemical science. All of the material included in a traditional general chemistry course is here. It has been reorganized in an atoms-first approach and, where necessary, new material has been added to allow for continuity and to improve the flow of topics. The text can be used for a traditional two-semester introduction to chemistry or for a three-semester introduction, an approach becoming more common at many institutions. The goal is to provide a progressive, graduated introduction to chemistry that focuses on the fundamentally atom-focused nature of the subject. Topics are introduced within the context of familiar experiences whenever possible, treated with an appropriate rigor to satisfy the intellect of the learner, and reinforced in subsequent discussions of related content. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from chemistry educators dedicated to the project.

To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity. Many illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students. Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.
