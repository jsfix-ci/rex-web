For a theory to be accepted, it must explain experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules. However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.</p>

                          There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an

                          <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.

                          >overlap</span> when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms’ positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.

                          >Figure 5.2</a> illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of

                          <sub>2</sub> contains a triple bond. The double bond consists of one σ bond and one π bond, and the triple bond consists of one σ bond and two π bonds. Between any two atoms, the first bond formed will always be a σ bond, but there can only be one σ bond in any one location. In any multiple bond, there will be one σ bond, and the remaining one or two bonds will be π bonds. These bonds are described in more detail later in this chapter.

                          Now that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of
                          electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the
                          connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the
                          chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble
                          gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That
                          is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable
                          configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.
                        </p>

                          Ions, in turn, can associate by charge – simple Coulombic attraction – resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds
                          first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms
                          bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the
                          covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely
                          ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as
                          polar.

                          In your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic
                          interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the
                          differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar
                          nature – not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection
                          between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between
                          charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges
                          divided by the square of the distance between those charges:

                            The concept of a bond dipole moment allows us to examine the partial separation of charge
                            between atoms. It is a simple model when applied to diatomic molecules, which will be more
                            than sufficient for our purposes. The dipole moment of a bond is defined as the charge times the
                            distance – charge once again being measured in multiples of the charge on an electron, or
                            coulombs. The distance will always be in meters. Because we are considering very small
                            charges and distances, and because it is the relative separation of charge rather than the actual
                            value for it that we are interested in, we will introduce a new unit called the Debye, named after
                            the physical chemist Peter Debye:

                            The concept of the bond dipole moment helps bridge the concepts of ionic and covalent bonding.
                            Because there is a separation of charge that is less complete than it is in an ionic bond, we can
                            refer to polar bonds as being partially ionic in nature. In contrast to sodium chloride, hydrogen
                            chloride shows partial charges (indicated with a delta notation) on the hydrogen and chlorine. As
                            you would expect from the electronegativity values, hydrogen carries a partial positive charge,
                            while chlorine carries a partial negative charge. Where do these charges come from?

                            It is easy to come up with the partial charges by comparing the actual dipole moments
                            (which can be obtained experimentally, using spectroscopy) with the dipole expected in the
                            limiting case (that is, if we were to consider the molecule ionic). The actual dipole moment is
                            1.03 D.

                            The electron configuration of an atom or ion is key to understanding the chemical
                            behavior of an element. The atoms that make up the element combine in various ways, ranging
                            from the mostly ionic (NaCl) to the partially ionic (HCl) to what we will call purely covalent.
                            At the most fundamental level, all chemical bonds involve electrons, and a significant percentage
                            of chemical and physical properties can be explained by considering the location and separation
                            of charge in a species. By understanding the structure of matter at the atomic level, we can begin
                            to build an understanding of the behavior of matter at both the microscopic and macroscopic
                            levels.
